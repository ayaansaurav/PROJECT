### Pizza Sales Analysis in Power BI

#### Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze key indicators of pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance and customer preferences using Power BI. The analysis will involve data cleaning, visualization, and calculation of various metrics.

#### Problem Statement:
The problem is to understand the performance of a pizza business by analyzing sales data. Specifically, my aim to calculate metrics such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, total orders, and average pizzas per order. Additionally, I want to visualize trends in total orders, sales distribution by pizza category and size, and the top and bottom performing pizzas using Power BI.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirement:
1. *Total Revenue*: Sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. *Average Order Value*: Average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing total revenue by total number of orders.
3. *Total Pizzas Sold*: Sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. *Total Orders*: Total number of orders placed.
5. *Average Pizzas Per Order*: Average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing total number of pizzas sold by total number of orders.

#### Requirement Gathering:
The project will focus on enhancing data analysis skills and creating insightful visualizations using Power BI to understand business trends and customer preferences.

#### Visualization in Power BI:
Utilizing Power BI, I have created various visualizations to meet the requirements:

1. *Daily Trend for Total Orders*: A bar chart displaying the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period.
2. *Monthly Trend for Total Orders*: A line chart illustrating the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day.
3. *Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category*: A pie chart showing the distribution of sales across different pizza categories.
4. *Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size*: A pie chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes.
5. *Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category*: A funnel chart presenting the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category.
6. *Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders*: Bar charts highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity, and total orders.
7. *Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders*: Bar charts showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity, and total orders.

#### Conclusion:
This project in Power BI provides a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data, allowing stakeholders to gain valuable insights into business performance and customer preferences. By understanding key metrics and visualizing trends, the business can make informed decisions to optimize operations and maximize revenue. Power BI offers a user-friendly interface for data exploration and visualization, making it an effective tool for analyzing and presenting insights from complex datasets.
